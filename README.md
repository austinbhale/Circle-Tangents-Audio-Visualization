# Circle Tangents Audio Visuals
Project made with Unity 2020.1.0f1.

### For more guidance on how this works, check out parts 0-4 of PeerPlay's Circle Tangent tutorial

### Additional Notes
As Peer Play describes in the tutorial, you can use an Xbox controller to interact with the circles. To get this interaction to work, you'd have to uncomment the PlayerInput function and set up input bindings.
